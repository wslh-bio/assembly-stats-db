# assembly-stats-db
This is a repository for a tool that generates a database from aggregated assembly statistics for the genomic analysis of bacteria that cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)

This database is created from downloading and calculating assembly statistics from [NCBI’s RefSeq Genomes Assembly Summary File](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/assembly_summary_refseq.txt).
